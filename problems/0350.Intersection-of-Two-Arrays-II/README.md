# 0350.[Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/)

## 題目

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example 1:**

```c
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```c
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
```

**Note:**

* Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
* The result can be in any order.

**Follow up:**

* What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
* What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
* What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
